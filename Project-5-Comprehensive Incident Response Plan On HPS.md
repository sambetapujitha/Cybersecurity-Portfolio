# **Comprehensive Incident Response Plan: Phishing Attack Scenario**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines a detailed process for creating and implementing
an incident response plan for a phishing attack scenario. The plan aims
to provide a structured approach to detecting, responding to, and
recovering from a security incident where an employee's email account
is compromised due to a phishing attack.

## **2. Scenario Details**

An employee received a convincing phishing email mimicking the
organization's IT department. The email prompted the employee to log in
to a fake portal, resulting in the theft of their corporate email
credentials. The attacker gained unauthorized access to the employee's
email account, potentially exposing sensitive information.

- Medium: Limited impact, potential minor data loss
- High: Significant impact, confirmed data loss or system compromise

Classify the phishing attack scenario as Medium severity
