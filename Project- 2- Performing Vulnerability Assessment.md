# Example 1: Vulnerability Assessment of a Web Application

## 1. Scope Definition

- System: E-commerce web application
- Components: Web server, application server, database server
- Assessment Tools: Nmap, OWASP ZAP, Nessus

## 2. Data Collection

- Network Scan: Using Nmap to identify open ports and services.
- Vulnerability Scan: Using Nessus to find known vulnerabilities.
- Web Application Scan: Using OWASP ZAP to test for web application vulnerabilities.

## 3. Performing the Assessment

### Network Scan with Nmap

```
nmap -sS -p 1-65535 -v -O -sV internetarchive.org
```

Results:

| PORT     | STATE | SERVICE | VERSION            |
|----------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| 80/tcp   | open  | http    | Apache httpd 2.4.29 |
| 443/tcp  | open  | https   | Apache httpd 2.4.29 |
| 3306/tcp | open  | mysql   | MySQL 5.7.21        |

### Web Application Scan with OWASP ZAP

Results:

- SQL Injection: Found in the login form, parameter username
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Found in the search functionality
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Missing CSRF tokens on critical actions

## 4. Data Analysis

- **SQL Injection:**
  - Impact: Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential full system compromise
  - Fix: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
  - Impact: User session hijacking, defacement, and phishing
  - Fix: Implement input validation and output encoding

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
  - Impact: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users
  - Fix: Implement CSRF tokens in forms and critical actions

## 5. Reporting

Executive Summary: The e-commerce web application is exposed to several high-risk vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, and XSS. Immediate actions should be taken to patch the systems and secure the application to prevent potential exploits.

**Detailed Report:**

- **Vulnerabilities Found:**
  - SQL Injection in login form
  - Cross-Site Scripting in search functionality
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery in critical actions

- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement prepared statements for database interactions
  - Validate and sanitize user inputs
  - Implement CSRF protection mechanisms

## 6. Remediation

- Code Fixes:
  - Implement secure coding practices for SQL queries and input handling

- Configuration Changes:
  - Harden server configurations to reduce attack surface

- Monitoring:
  - Set up continuous monitoring and regular vulnerability scans to detect and address new vulnerabilities promptly
